# Welcome to my Portfolio repository!

This repository (as you may have guessed) contains the source code for my personal Portfolio/Website.

This portfolio uses technologies like:
- React
- GSAP
- Tailwind CSS

This website was designed to be similar to MacOS.

Using React, I created the Navbar, Dock, and the kernel functionality of adding each of the apps and windows that display when clicking on each individual app. 

To make the icons and windows interactive, I utilized the GSAP library to add an interactive layer to my the site to add a fun touch!

When creating the website, I prioritized using clean and resuable React architectures while learning how to use Higher-Order Components and managing global states using Zustand.
