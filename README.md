# Welcome to my Portfolio repository!

This repository (as you may have guessed) contains the source code for my personal Portfolio/Website.

This portfolio uses technologies like:
- React as the core language
- GSAP for interactive elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jenkins for CI/CD
- CodeRabbit for PR/Code review

This website was designed to be similar to MacOS.

Using React, I emmulated the kernel functionality of MacOS while adding each of the apps, windows, and files that display when clicking on each individual app. 

Using `react-pdf` I was able to add pdf reader-like functionality to display my resume.

To make the icons and windows interactive, I utilized the GSAP library to add an interactive layer to my the site to add a fun touch!

When creating the website, I prioritized using clean and reusable React architectures while learning how to use Higher-Order Components and managing global states using Zustand.
